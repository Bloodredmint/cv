        <p>I am a full time worker and father to three. I developed a passion of coding whilst recovering from a broken leg late last year. An extended period of time like that really did spark the fire and I enrolled with FreeCodeCamp.org, where I
          quickly worked through the lessons and gained some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Struggling to understand the Javascript, I signed up for an account with Udemy and pursued Javascript course.<br />Whilst moving through the JS
          course, I decided on a project, make a web app of Yatzhee. Unfortnately, at was time to go back to work and coding went on the back burner until recently. I have enrolled on another course through Udemy covering web development and other
          associated technologies. Hopefully I can work out the best way to start my project</p>
